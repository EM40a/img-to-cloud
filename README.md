# Upload your images to the cloud

In this project, we will be using the **cloudinary API** to upload images to the cloud. We will also be using the **loading.io** website to create a loading spinner for the upload button.

## Getting Started

To get started, you can either clone the repository or download the files to your local machine.

- Run `pnpm install` to install the project dependencies.
- Then run `pnpm dev` to start the development server.

- Open [http://localhost:4321](http://localhost:4321) with your browser to see the result.

Now you can start uploading images to the cloud.

>[!IMPORTANT]
> You will need to create an account on [cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/) to get your cloud name, API key, and API secret. You will also need to create a `.env` file in the root of the project and add the following environment variables:

```env
API_SECRET = your_api_secret
```
